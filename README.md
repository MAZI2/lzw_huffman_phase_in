# LZW compression with Huffman codes
LZW compressed sequences in blocks encoded with dynamic huffman encoding. Similar to deflate. 
Header structure and double huffman encoding similar to [RFC 1951](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/RFC-1951#packing](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/RFC-1951#dyn )

Has some weird issues with larger files...
# LZW compression with Phase-in codes
LZW compressed sequence is encoded with phase-in codes
